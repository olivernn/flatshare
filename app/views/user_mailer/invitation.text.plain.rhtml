I hope that your advert is a successful one and you are getting lots of genuine interest.  I know that when I was trying to use flatsharing websites when moving out of my previous flat it was a bit of a nightmare, so much so that I thought I would try and do something about it, which is why I set up http://LondonFlatmate.net

http://LondonFlatmate.net is a new website which aims to make the whole process a lot easier, we are brand new and we really need people to come over and have a look, sign up and give us some feedback.

The whole thing is completely free so why not come over to http://LondonFlatmate.net and create an advert, it can't hurt to have one more advert out there can it!

Thanks,

Oliver
