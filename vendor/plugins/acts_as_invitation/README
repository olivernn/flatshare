= Acts as Invitation

Make your Rails site virally Web 2.0 complaint by adding the 
+acts_as_invitation+ plugin!

Acts as Invitation allows you to easily add "send to a friend" functionality
to any of your model classes. You create a new class to represent the 
invitations sent. Then add <tt>has_many :invitations</tt> to your model.

== Usage

Install the plugin with:

  script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/slantwise/acts_as_invitation/trunk acts_as_invitation


Run the included generator to create your invitation model.

  script/generate invitation Invitation

("+Invitation+" can be what ever you want -- +SendToFriend+, 
+Recommendation+, etc.)

This will create an +Invitation+ model and an +InvitationMailer+.

Open up the generated +Invitation+ model to make any changes you need.

Your +Invitation+ model can be polymorphic if you want to track invitations
of multiple classes, or simply set it to +belong_to+ a single model.

Then, change your models you want to be "inviteable", add 
<tt>has_many :invitations</tt>.

Finally, create your views and ensure your SMTP server is configure properly.
